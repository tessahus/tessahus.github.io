			<p> 
			My name is Tessa Husemann - I like to see people happy, and love to see them happy working together. My life's work is to help people discover their best selves and creative solutions to their problems. I grease the wheels of human communication in all the ways, big and small, that make a difference.
			</p>
			<p>
			Outside of work, I like to travel the world by bike, foot, and sailboat.
			</p>
			<p>	
			I'm based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have clients around the world. In addition to the US, I've practiced and studied in Germany, France, Australia, and Brazil, and bring a fresh, international perspective to difficult problems. I speak fluent English, Spanish, German, and French.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here's my <strong><big><a href="resume.pdf">resume</a></big></strong>.

			<h1><a name="conflictcoaching">Conflict Coaching</a></h1>
			<p>
				I train individuals and teams to master conflict and to prevent it from happening in the first place. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal is to empower individuals to be self-sufficient conflict solvers who are aware of their emotions and use their personal strengths effectively. My training and coaching sessions are available to groups or individuals, and are always interactive and practical: instead of listening to a lecture, participants experiment with tricky situations from their own experiences and prototype new tools for the future.
			<p>
				Recent clients: University of Lyon (France), Mozilla Corporation, Peet's Coffee and Tea, Oakland Unified School District.
			</p><br><br><br>

			<h1><a name="mediation">Mediation</a></h1>
			<p>
				I steer conflicts towards managable solutions and work through smaller tensions that threaten to cause trouble down the road. I facilitate tough conversations to overcome obstacles and help relationships - professional and personal - get back on track. I don't give orders or tell people what to do. Rather, I help frame the conversation and guide the participants to outcomes of their own making. I'm the neutral third party who helps people listen to and understand each other, because that's what makes solutions stick.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have successfully mediated well over one hundred cases to an agreement between all parties involved. Confidentially prevents me from listing clients publicly, but I can describe the kinds of scenarios that make up those successes.
			<h2>1. In the Workplace</h2>
			<p>
				Organizations are incubators of change, and with change naturally comes conflict. Team members often develop tension over leadership and responsibilities. Conflicts also arise between teams, due to misaligned goals, disagreement over what's important, or good old-fashioned personality conflicts. Most workers just want to make the organization better, so it's frustrating when their efforts give way to friction and deadlock. I can help with all of that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Areas of Experience:
			<ul>
				<li>leadership transitions</li>
				<li>harassment</li>
				<li>conflicts between teams</li>
				<li>conflicts between co-workers</li>
				<li>conflicts between business partners</li>
				<li>conflicts between companies</li>
				<li>conflicts between companies and clients</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>2. Everywhere Else</h2>
			<p>
				Conflict is everywhere, not just in the workplace. I have practiced extensively as a community mediator as well as a mediator for the court system, which has given me a lot of insight in how all disputes, big and small, can be overcome.
			</p>
			<p>
				Areas of Experience:
			<ul>
				<li>civil harassment</li>
				<li>conflicts between landlords, tenants, homeowner associations, and city authorities</li>
				<li>conflicts between neighbors</li>
				<li>automobile accident damage disputes</li>
			</ul><br><br>
			<h1><a name="organizationaldevelopment">Organizational Development</a></h1>
			<p>
				I do what it takes to help people find better ways to work together. I help leaders to communicate well: clarifying intentions, aligning goals, and balancing responsibilities. I also design action plans to develop strong teams and increase effectiveness. These plans include measures for:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the hiring process</li>
				<li>employee development</li>
				<li>engagement strategies</li>
				<li>evaluation and assessment</li>
				<li>shaping culture</li>
				<li>inclusion and diversity</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><br><br><br><br>

			<p> 
				My services and track record speak for themselves. "People problems" waste incredible amounts of money through lost time, diminished productivity, and complicated litigation. They can make an entire organization grind to a halt, but don't need to. With guidance, these "problems" can become opportunities to unlock potential and generate important changes. A few hours of professional intervention can save days, weeks, or even months of time and energy that could be better spent on other things. In short: my services are efficient, cost-effective, and make good business sense.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the business parts aren't what keep me doing this. I care deeply about people, and derive immense satisfaction from seeing destructive situations turn constructive. Over and over again, my clients learn to overcome obstacles and figure things out, even when those obstacles have long and painful histories. It feels like magic, and is so exciting for me that I've devoted my life to making it happen.
