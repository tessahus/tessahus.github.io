			<p> 
			My name is Tessa Husemann - I like it when people are happy, and I like it even more when people are happy working together. I grease the wheels of human communication in all the little things that make a difference. My life's work is to help people discover their best selves and creative solutions to their problems. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition to my work, I like to travel the world by bike, foot and sailboat.
			</p>
			<p>	
			I'm based in the San Francisco Bay Area but operate internationally through videoconferencing. I speak English, Spanish, German and French.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here's my <strong><big><a href="resume.pdf">resume</a></big></strong>.

			<h1><a name="whatido">Mediation</a></h1>
			<p>
			If somebody asks me what I do, my answer would be simply: <strong><big>"I mediate"</strong></big>.
			</p>
			<p>
			I facilitate tough conversations to overcome obstacles - big and small - and help professional and personal relationships to go back on track. I don't give orders or tell people what to do - but I frame the conversation and guide the participants to outcomes of their own making. I'm the neutral third person who helps people listen to and understand each other, because that's what makes solutions stick.

			<h1><a name="fororgs">For organizations</a></h1>
			<p>
				Organizations are in incubator of change, and with change naturally come tensions. Different teams can have conflicts with each other because the teams' goals differ, or teams just have different priorities with what they want to deal with to make the organization as a whole work. Or maybe this conflict lies in one specific team and makes it unable for to keep up with the work pace of the others not facing a conflict. There can also be tensions around leadership and responsibilities, or simply an desire to make the workplace a better place. 

			<p>
				Depending on your needs, I can manage change by: 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>> Steering a conflict within the organization towards managable solutions</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>> Working through smaller tensions and different styles of communication and behaviour</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>> Clarifying intentions, and aligning goals & responsibilities around a common project so that everybody is on the same page.</span>
			</p><br><br><br><hr><br><br>

			<h1><a name="forinds">For individuals</a></h1>
			<p>
			Do you have a conflict with your co-worker, former business partner, another company, your neigbor or even a family member? It's never too late to resolve it.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="red">Conflict coaching:</span> I will listen carefully to your story and help you find out what's really important to you and what you can do to resolve the issue.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="red">Mediation:</span> After having talked to both parties separately, and only if both parties agree to give mediation a try, I will facilitate confidential conversations to resolve the issue. 
			</p><br><br><br><hr><br><br>

			<h1><a name="philosophy">Philosophy</a></h1>
			<p> 
				One may argue that the things I do are great because they're highly cost- and time-efficient. And yes, that's true. I'm certainly happy to help people spend less ressources on unpleasant issues. But my main motivation is different: I believe that under certain conditions, <span class="red">conflict is an opportunity to generate positive change</span> that benefits everyone. It <span class="red">increases effectiveness</span>, and it <span class"red">increases participation</span>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My role is to mobilize these forces, get people together and align the various ideas people have, because I want everyone to have the opportunity to feel strong and empowered, to have an impact and radically move forward.
			<p>
				And it works - In about 90% of my interventions, people are not only happy with the process but have found practicable solutions and/or agreed upon a detailed master plan. It's extremely rewarding for me to see people shaking hands at the end, having coffee together and starting to talk with each other with full respect. And this doesn't take a lot. But it requires a third party delivering a structured process, along with some simple rules.
